# pandas-challenge

This 4th homework challenge had us look at data for the PyCity school distrivt.  We were asked to analyze data regarding standardized math and reading rest results.  Looking at the size of the school, budget per school and student, and charter vs. district schools.

To do the analysis we had to pull in our data, and merge it into a single data set. District stats were completed and then a summary of the schools were made. Groupby functions were done to look at individual school data, as well as district vs. charter schools. Sorts were done to look at the highest and lowest schools. Grade level scores for reading and math were done by seperating the data into grades.  Bins were utilized to seperate the data into school spending buckets, as well as school size buckets. 

I had some challenges with this assignemnt, determining [] vs (). I also had the oppotunity to figure out how to fix the errors in my code when it wasn't working correctly and problem solcve.  BCS helped out when I got really stuck trying to determine some pof the issues, most of which were the issues with series regarding data frames. 

This assignment also helpe me understand some real life scenarios with this data. I work in a health care field, but seeing how you can merge the data, and then run different code to help slice and dice it to undersand what the data is telling us.
